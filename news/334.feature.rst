``requirementslib`` has converted off of pip-shims project which had grown into a complicated interface to using ``pip``.
It was problematic because ``pip-shims`` could never foresee and accommodate future looking changes to internal interfaces of ``pip``.
Also, ``pip-shims`` slowed down this library and required downstream tools such as ``pipenv`` to continue vendoring it despite having already dropped usages.
Due to the impact of this change, it requires a major version increase of ``requirementslib`` to ``2.0.0``
To utilize version ``2.0.0`` of ``requirementslib``, ensure you have ``pip>=22.2`` as this has not been fully tested to support earlier versions of ``pip``
Breakage of the internal ``pip`` interface usage is possible with earlier versions.
Additionally, the interface on ``NamedRequierment`` renamed class method ``get_dependencies`` to ``dependencies`` and ``get_abstract_dependencies`` to ``abstract_dependencies`` in order to match interface with ``Line`` class and avoid naming collision with the utility methods they call.
